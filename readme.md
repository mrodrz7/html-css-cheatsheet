## Purpose & Future Edits

<p>The purpose behind this little project is to get back into Software Engineering full force, post-pandemic - what better way to start than with the building blocks of Web Development, HTML & CSS!</p>

<p>This project was inspired by the Developers & Instructors over at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" alt="Link to Code Academy website">Codeacademy</a>.

<p>It can also be a great refresher and form of studying/learning for fresh new developers getting familiar with so many news terms and syntax!</p>

<p>Use my code as a reference and feel free to add on to it!</p>
